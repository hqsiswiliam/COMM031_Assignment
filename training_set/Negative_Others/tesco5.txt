I think I might go to the halal butcher later to get some chicken for tea. Cheaper and better quality than Tesco's chicken.

so all of the supermarkets have been selling halal meat secretly #Tesco

That blue spark from tesco is lethal. Think I've had three heart attacks from one can.

They dont mind horse meat pies from Tesco but theyre hating on halal meat sandwiches from Subway ??

@Tesco Why was I charged more for my lunchtime sandwich than the price displayed on the packaging? See photo http://t.co/XmwMHbvrww
